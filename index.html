    <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Introduction</h2><p>&#9995</p>
        <p style="background-color: dodgerblue;">Hello, my name is Chris and I am currently a student at Lewis University. I am the oldest in my family, and I have two younger brothers and one sister.
            I am currently seeking to obtain my B.S. in Computer Science/Cbyersecurity degree. I have many years of experince with security on the physical end. I spent
            nearly 9 years as a law enforcement officer, and now I currently work in the nuclear security field. I hope to combine my experinces with physical security 
            with computer security and obtain a rewarding career in the field. I have so far found this very challenging, but also exciting. I look forward
            to finally finishing my degree!</p>
        <p style="background-color: dodgerblue;">I currently live in Joliet, and love spending time with my two little nieces. My girlfriend lives in Lemont and works as a crisis social worker
            for high risk children in Will County. I have two cats, and used to have a dog until recently. Really miss him! I hope these little two paragraphs, helps
            you better understand a little about me!
        </p>
    <h3>What I hope to Learn in this Course!</h3>
    <p style="background-color: gold;">I hope to gain insight and basic knowledge of computer programming! I enjoy the history of computer programming and hope to be successful in the field!</p><p>&#128214</p>

    <h5> My Favorite Hobby</h5>
    <p>&#128641</p>
    <p style="background-color: red;">My favorite hobby has always been aviation. I have enjoyed flying since I was a young age. It was an interest, that my grandfather and I shared. I think that 
        makes it even more meaningful to me. I am fascinated by all aspects of flight. I enjoyed reading, visting avivation museums and learning. I have went all over the
        country visitng museums. I was honored to meet WWII veterans and learn about their experinces. In my youth I wanted to be in the United States Airforce. When I was
        in high school, I was in the auxillary of the Airforce. It gave me many opportunies to experince aviation. I was able to experince many USAF installations, speak
        to many great American heros and learned so much! Had I been medically cleared to fly, I would have happily join the USAF, but I have high blood pressure.  </p>
